Recently I was contemplating of starting marketing my own business. Typically I acquires new customers from word of mouth.

Marketing has been proven difficult for me to start. It is by nature as perfectionist, I tended to make sure that I have all of the information before I got started and that is the reason why I have delayed to start working on the my business marketing.

From now on, I will write one post a day regardless how difficult it takes.
