Last time we chat, you've mentioned that you were worried that if you ended restructuing the teclabs site splitting into 2 sites and it will hurt the SEO due to duplicate content.

I was working on similar project this week and found this link regarding how to solve duplicate content
<br>Here is the summary of what you can do:

1. Use 301 redirect
   <br>You will need to ask your developers to add redirect directive on the website.

2. Use Rel=Canonical ( preferred way)
   <br>All you need is add meta tag on the header of the page
   <br>Here is an example:

""

1. Request google spider not to crawl the duplicate page.
   <br>Similar to the #2, by adding robot meta tag will give a hint for google spider not to index this page.
   <br>Here is an example :

More detailed info can be found on this link

Hope you find it helpful,
<br>Leon

PS: I spent some time experimenting with Chatfuel. You are right ! This is an awesome tool to generate awareness in the facebook platfom. I think you should figure out how to implement this and see if work out well for your marketing campaign.
