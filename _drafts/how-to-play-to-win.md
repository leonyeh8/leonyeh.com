As an avid college football fan, I don’t know how many time I watched many games where my beloved team USC Trojans who has already ahead in the score ended up losing because they played not too loose.

A winning team should never takes it easy, until the last seconds on the clock winding down. Unfortunately, even the best team has a down day. They got tired, and makes stupid mistakes. Then quickly it affected their thinking. They stop taking actions and stop running. They started to believe the that the best way they can be win the game is by playing it safe.They worried more about getting injuries, then tackling. They stayed in the back when they should on offense. They assume incorrectly that by playing safe, they are assuring the victory at hand, instead typically they got the opposite result.

Working in sales and marketing, it share quite a similarity with playing football. It is both a team sport where you can play defense or offense. Playing defensive can be synonymous with relying on your affiliates for traffic instead of figuring out a new way to grow the traffic. Or, cutting corner by buying someone else list instead of creating your own email list.

You can always see the the mindset of the defensive client. It shown on how they are planning for digital marketing campaign. Deep down they don’t believe they can create greater value. You can see the metrics they chose, all about the daily ads campaign instead of looking into the customer life time value. Instead of long term winning activities, they opted to dip their toes in the google ads pay per click etc.

What &nbsp;separate a winning team with a losing team in digital marketing could be as little as the right mindset. &nbsp;As a digital marketer, I teamed up my client to achieve one single objective. The shared objective is measured by profit margin and business growth.

<br>&nbsp;

I have worked with many different type of clients. Some of them think marketing is just a cost and trying to do it as little as possible. This is what I called playing defensive. However my ideal client is the one that has the &nbsp;growth mentality. They consider winning never come easy. It is done by hustling and always playing offense. They considered marketing as the necessary investment needed to properly funded and an integral part of their quest of accelerating their growth.

Start with A Growth MIND SET

If you’re in digital marketing, you need to start with Growth Mindset. What you are doing is always about accelerating your client business. Do NOT do what is the typical things other do. Do what scare you and put the hours to make it perfect. Be accountable and always believe, Believe that you can do more.

Steve Backley &gt; Quotes &gt; Quotable Quote

“There are three types of people in this world. Firstly, there are people who make things happen. Then there are people who watch things happen. Lastly, there are people who ask, what happened? Which do you want to be?”

Instead of waiting for others for a better strategy, starts with your own. You will make mistakes, will get bruised by reality but you will learn and grow stronger. Winning can be done, but takes time and persistence.

It’s the mindset of people who continuously acquire new clients, develop new products to market, punch above their division, and who believe “W” isn’t very difficult to make. Because these different beliefs are true to those who hold them, they become their reality.
